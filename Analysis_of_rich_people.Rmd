This is the R project of Fabian and Robin. We decided to analyse data from billionaires.  
For that, we found a dataset on kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/billionaires-statistics-dataset  
This dataset contains data from the 4th of april 2023 and is used for 'exploring the global landscape of success'.  

```{r}
# We used these libraries:
library(ggplot2) # to plot graphs and images
```

# Read the CSV file into a dataframe called df_billionaires

```{r}
df_billionaires <- read.csv("BillionairesStatisticsDataset.csv")
# display data
head(df_billionaires)
```

# We first started by creating a list of the top 10 richest billionaires:

```{r}
# Create a data frame with the top 10 billionaires
top_10_billionaires <- df_billionaires[1:10, ]
```

## Plot the top 10 richest billionaires
```{r}
# Create a bar plot with text labels
plot <- ggplot(top_10_billionaires, aes(x = reorder(personName, -finalWorth), y = finalWorth, fill = personName)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0("$", finalWorth, "B")), vjust = -0.5, color = "black", size = 3) + # Add text labels
  labs(
    title = "Top 10 Billionaires and their Net Worth",
    x = "Billionaires",
    y = "Net Worth (in billions USD)",
    fill = "Billionaire"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Print the plot
print(plot)
```
  
The plot displays ten bars in a barchart. Each bar represents the wealth of
one billionaire. The bar only displays the top 10 richest billionaires.
The height of the bar represents the wealth of the billionaire in US-dollars.

# Next Steps

Next, we decided to formulate a thesis. Based on the dataset, we decided that we want
to formulate our thesis about the correlation and causation between certain data
columns and the wealth of the billionaires. Maybe this lets us speculate on certain
circumstances that make it easier or harder for someone to become a billionaire.

In the following we will create multiple plots to compare the correlation between certain
data columns and the wealth. Because this dataset only contains billionaires, we won't
focus on the difference between their wealth. Being part of this dataset is rich enough ;

# Ideas
ICH HÃ„TTE ULTRA BOCK EIN PLOT ZU ERSTELLEN; INDEM ICH DEN WOHNORT AUF EINER WELTKARTE ALS
PLOT DARSTELLE. ALSO IRGENDWAS MIT MAP. (falls es dir nichts ausmacht.)
